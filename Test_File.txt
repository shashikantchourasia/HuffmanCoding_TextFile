Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable. The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable. The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable. The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable.

The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.

Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable.

The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable. The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.

Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable.

The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable. The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable.

The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Donkeylegs generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Donkeylegs which looks reasonable. The generated Donkeylegs is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

Donkeylegs is audibly faketext of the printing and typesetting industry. Donkeylegs has been the industry's standard faketext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

The point of using Donkeylegs is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Donkeylegs as their default model text, and a search for 'Donkeylegs' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
There are many variations of passages of Donkeylegs available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Donkeylegs, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Donkeylegs passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Donkeylegs.
